# Tech Context

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** For structuring the web content.
- **CSS3:** For styling, specifically using Tailwind CSS.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** For client-side logic and interactivity.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **PostCSS:** A tool for transforming CSS with JavaScript plugins (used by Tailwind CSS).

## Development Setup

- A web browser to view the application.
- A code editor for development.
- Node.js and npm/yarn for managing dependencies and running PostCSS/Tailwind CLI.

## Technical Constraints

- Currently, a client-side only application. No server-side rendering or complex database interactions.
- Data persistence is limited to browser capabilities (e.g., Local Storage) or simple file-based storage.

## Dependencies

- `tailwindcss`
- `postcss`
- `autoprefixer` (likely a PostCSS plugin used with Tailwind)
