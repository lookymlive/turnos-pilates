# Progress

## What works

- Initial project setup with HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), and JavaScript files.
- Basic styling capabilities with Tailwind CSS configured.
- Core memory bank documentation structure established.
- Dynamic rendering of pilates class schedules from `main.js`'s `defaultScheduleData`.
- Functionality for users to sign up for classes with capacity enforcement.
- Data persistence implemented using `localStorage` for schedule and sign-up data.
- Export and import functionality for schedule data via JSON files.
- Day and time slot selection with visual feedback for current selection.
- Non-intrusive notification system for user feedback.
- Enhanced error handling and input validation for data import and sign-ups.
- Print functionality for the schedule table.

## What's left to build

- Potential for an administrative interface to modify schedules directly.
- User authentication and management.
- Payment integration.
- More advanced reporting or analytics.

## Current status

- The core functionality for managing pilates class schedules, including sign-ups, data persistence, and basic UI/UX enhancements, is complete and functional as per the initial plan.

## Known issues

- The application is client-side only; no server-side component for robust data management or user accounts.
- The `horarios_pilates.md` file is now a static reference and not actively parsed by the application.
